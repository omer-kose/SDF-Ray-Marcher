# Ray Marching with SDFs (CENG469_Term_Project)
Ömer Köse - Gökcan Demiralp

# Compile and Run
- Just by running the Makefile by using the regular "make" command the files compile

- After that, the executable can be run with the usual "./main" command

# Change the Scene
- Then the hard-coded scene which is specified in the main.cpp file will be executed

- At the line "318" in "main.cpp" the scene can be changed

- for example "scene = terrainScene;" can be changed to "scene = buildingScene;"

# Controls
- The camera can be moved inside the scene by using the "WASD" keys

- While pressing the Left-Mouse-Button the viewing-angle/perspective can be changed by moving the mouse

- You can go up by clicking the "SPACE bar" or go down with the "CTRL" key

- The program can be terminated with the ESC key

# Blog Link

We have written a blog for our project. You can find the visual outputs and a video showcasing the results.

# TODO
- Add a ImGUI drop down menu to select the scene as selecting the scene by changing the code is not a good idea.
